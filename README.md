# Bank-Customer-Churn
Machine Learning model for determining whether bank customers will churn or not

We are given the dataset about bank information of around 10000 customers and also given if they have churned or not.

Our task is to build a ML model such that we can predict if a customer is going to churn or not. We will also perform EDA on this dataset to inform the bank on what they could do to minimise the churn and build a sustainable business. We are going to implement multiple machine learning models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, etc.
